	! My comments !
It was notoriously difficult to write this code,
I believe that I missunderstood something in the book.
Also, it is very hard for me to follow ppt and a class,
ppt is very hard to read,
class very hard to understand since it is in chinese.

	! About the code !
Sorry the code is very messy!
I made some comments in the code, you may read them!

Best regards!
